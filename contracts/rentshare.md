we dun have pools 
gotta do this without staking. 
reward is distributed per second. 
we will be using afterTokenTransfer hook in erc20
sushiReward token contract is only taking(in the constructor) one reward token. so if we have USDC we gotta put that in there but again we dun have the mint functionality so as asim bhai said we gotta have our own usd pegged token which has the mint functionality. so we can just put it in there.
